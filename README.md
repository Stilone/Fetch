# Fetch 🚀

Hello! Welcome to my Fetch Playground. In this small project, I dived into the world of fetch requests and experimented with the delightful setTimeout. Feel free to download and explore the project by opening the index.html file.

# Key Highlights 🌟

Fetch Requests: Explored the basics of making fetch requests to interact with APIs.
setTimeout Magic: Experimented with setTimeout to add a touch of asynchronous charm to the project.

# Project Structure 📁

index.html: The heart of the project. Open this file to dive into the Fetch Playground.
styles.css: Some minimal styling to make things visually appealing.
script.js: The JavaScript file where the fetch requests and setTimeout magic happen.

# How to Run 🏃‍♂️
Simply download the project and open the index.html file in your browser to experience the Fetch Playground.
