# Fetch 🚀

Hello! Welcome to my project Fetch. In this small project, I dived into the world of fetch requests and experimented with the delightful setTimeout.

# Key Highlights 🌟

Fetch Requests: Explored the basics of making fetch requests to interact with APIs.
setTimeout Magic: Experimented with setTimeout to add a touch of asynchronous charm to the project.

# Project Structure 📁

- index.html: The heart of the project. Open this file to dive into the Fetch.
- css.css: Some minimal styling to make things visually appealing.
- first.js: The JavaScript file where the fetch requests and setTimeout magic happen.

# How to Run 🏃‍♂️
Simply download the project and open the index.html file in your browser to experience the Fetch.

# Screenshots 📸
